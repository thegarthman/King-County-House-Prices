Predicting King County Housing Prices - Kaggle Dataset

Downloaded this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

The goal of this project was to do some exploratory data analysis with R and predict housing prices using machine learning algorithms. I used linear models, ridge regression, lasso, random forests, and xgboost.

After using an ensemble of XGBoost and Random Forest, I achieved an RMSE of 66k.

I would like to try looking into using zipcode, latitude, and longitude in more depth.
